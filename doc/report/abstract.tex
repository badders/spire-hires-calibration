The photometers contained within the Herschel SPIRE instrument have an angular resolution limited only by diffraction, where the $500\units{\mu m}$ photometer is limited to an angular resolution of approximately 35''. Here I present an investigation into the use of a super-resolution technique (HiRes) first implemented for IRAS. A set of possible methodologies for quantifying the performance of HiRes is presented, and a method where measuring RMS pixel differences for a synthetic observation is identified as a suitable way to quantify the HiRes improvement of an unmodified observation. Also established is a possible threshold of 99th percentile peak SNR of \textgreater30 where HiRes can be automatically applied to an observation as part of the work of the SPIRE post operations team.
